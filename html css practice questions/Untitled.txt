🔹 Basic Level

1. Create a div with position: relative; and put another div inside it with position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 20px;.
👉 Where will the inner div appear?

2. Make a header fixed at the top of the page (position: fixed; top: 0; width: 100%;).
👉 What happens when you scroll the page?

3. Place three divs one after another. Set the second one to position: sticky; top: 10px;.
👉 What happens when you scroll?

🔹 Intermediate

4. You have four small boxes inside a parent container. Set the parent to position: relative;.

Place each child with position: absolute; at different corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
👉 Which CSS properties will you use?

5. Create an image gallery with small images. Make one image position: absolute; z-index: 2; overlapping another.
👉 Which image will be visible on top?

🔹 Basic Practice

6. Create two divs and use float: left; to place them side by side.
👉 What happens if you don’t set a width for them?

7. Place an image inside a paragraph and use float: right;.
👉 Does the text wrap around the image?

8. Make three boxes: red, green, blue. Float all to the left.
👉 What layout do you get?

🔹 Clear Property

9. Add two floated boxes (float: left;) and below them add another box.
👉 What happens if you don’t use clear? What if you use clear: both;?

10. Float one box left, another right, then add a footer.
👉 How do you keep the footer below both?

🔹 Overflow Property

11. Create a parent div with a fixed height and add a child box floated inside.
👉 What happens if you don’t set overflow on the parent?

12. Apply overflow: hidden; to the parent.
👉 Does the parent now contain the floated child?

13. Add too much text inside a small container.
👉 Try overflow: scroll;, overflow: hidden;, and overflow: auto; — what differences do you see?
