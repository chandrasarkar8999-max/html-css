      This is a paragraph of text. Notice how the image is floated to the right
      side of the paragraph. The text will flow around the image and continue on
      the left side. If the paragraph is long enough, the text will keep
      wrapping around until it reaches the bottom of the image, and then it will
      stretch the full width.
